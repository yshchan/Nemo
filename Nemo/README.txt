h3. New Projects

When creating a new project...

1. Choose a template
2. Add your extensions, supporting files, categories, anything.
3. Then add your additional views (for example a custom cell)
4. Add your controllers.
5. Link anything that is required to be linked to Storyboard
6. Hopefully if you designed your system modularily, the build will go smoothly!
